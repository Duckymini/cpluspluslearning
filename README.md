# C++ Learning Exercises

This repository tracks my progress while studying Herbert Schildt's *C++: A Beginner's Guide (Second Edition)*. Each chapter in the book concludes with small projects, and I am re-creating those examples here to sharpen my understanding of the language.

## Repository Layout

- `Module 1/` — introductory programs that cover the basics, such as simple I/O, arithmetic, and working with variables.
- `Module 2/` — intermediate exercises focused on control flow, functions, and small problem-solving challenges (for example, range calculators, XOR experiments, and prime number checks).
- `Module 3/` — reserved for upcoming projects as I progress through the later chapters.

The repository also contains compiled binaries produced while experimenting with the examples. These are kept alongside the source files for now so I can quickly rerun programs as I revisit concepts.

## Running the Examples

All code is written in standard C++. To compile and run any program:

```bash
g++ path/to/file.cpp -o output_binary
./output_binary
```

(You can replace `g++` with another C++17-compatible compiler if you prefer.)

Feel free to explore, compare your own solutions to mine, or suggest improvements as I continue learning.
